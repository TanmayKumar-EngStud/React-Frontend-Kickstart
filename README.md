# React kickstart

### About:

This repository is for you to start creating your react application faster. Sometimes what happens is that when we start building projects, we don't actually organize the project components properly. Complexity increases if we keep on adding more and more components. Thus complexity increases with scalability.

### The Idea:

This repository will provide you a pre-build setup, sort of a kickstart that will help you to start building quickly. The files and folders are arranged in such a way that there would be no difficulty in solving a bug, moreover it will keep things organized and will help you in maintaining the uniformity even when the project gets big.

### Pre-requisite:

You would only need npm installed in your System

### The Setup:

I would sound funny if it is named kickstart and it is taking so many things to even start. Thus the setup is pretty simple here:

1. Download this repository
2. go to that project directory and run `npm install` this will install all the packages that are named inside `package.json`

### The perks:

How it will help me? Well here are the list of things which will benifit you for your faster productivity.

1. React's both Class based and Function based files are available and are pre-connected. ( There are VS code extensions to quickly build the Class based component or the function based component, but here these components are also connected to the Redux storage. )
2. React-Redux connection is pre-connected.
3. For Animation Framer-Motion will also get added inside node_modules
4. React-router-dom is pre-connected.
5. lazy loading is also established before hand.
6. There are two web pages and two web components that are already built-in.
7. Redux's storage has two data sections which are having all the general/ideal reducers inside it.
8. Directories are organized before hand in such a way that it will be easy to scale at the time of project creation.
9. In every repository I will add more readme files, which will guide in understanding the uniformity and will also help you in maintaining it.
10. Fontawesome version 6.2.0 is added, you can directly use all the free fontawesome icons.

### Cons:

There might be some of the modules that you might not be interested in, like Redux or Framer-motion. These modules will get installed. For now, I have no knowledge of testing, Thus I have removed all the .js files related to it.
I will add the testing files later.
After Learning about backend development, I will also add code regarding to it that will also be helpful.

**Final Note**: This repository is build with an intension of quickly starting up the new project and creating a nomenclature that will help us in keeping things simple and scalable.

### This might only be helpful for beginners, as i am a beginner i have build this with my own expectations
